Benedictory Verses for The Clarifying Light: A Prophecy of the Future

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Through the virtue of the wholesome actOf printing this prophetic teachingOf the incomparable
perfect BuddhaSo that those with faith may uphold it,May the ills of this degenerate time
be dispelled,May we all find the relief of a perfect, golden age,May the jewel-in-the-sky
of joy and happiness dawn,And may we swiftly gain unsurpassable, enduring excellence.

The Khyentse emanation made this prayer of aspiration. May virtue and excellence thrive.

These prophecies of what is to come clearly foretoldBy the supreme teacher, seer of the three
times,Were compiled by Chökyi Lodrö, Vajradhara in person,Out of loving kindness for the
beings of the degenerate age.

May all who practise this with faith and devotionAnd a wholly positive intention towards teachings
and beings,Be freed entirely from the ten major forms of terrorAnd swiftly attain ultimate
omniscience.

Maṅgalaṃ.
